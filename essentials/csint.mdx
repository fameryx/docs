</Tip>

---

## <Icon icon="envelope" iconType="solid" size={24} /> Email search

Search an email to find linked accounts, public exposures and breach hits.

#### Example:

```text
test@gmail.com
```

<Note>
- Returns linked profiles, indexed mentions and breach dataset hits (when available).  
- Use full email for best precision; partials may return noisy results.
</Note>

---

## <Icon icon="server" iconType="solid" size={24} /> IP search

Lookup an IP to surface observed connections, hosting info and related records.

#### Example:

```text
203.0.113.45
```

<Note>
- IP results can include session logs, reports and associated identifiers (when indexed).  
</Note>

---

## <Icon icon="phone" iconType="solid" size={24} /> Phone number

Search by phone number. Prefer international (normalized) formats for consistency.

#### Example:

```text
061234567
```

<Note>
- Normalize local numbers (country code) for best matches.  
</Note>

---

## <Icon icon="gamepad" iconType="solid" size={24} /> Minecraft UID

Lookup Minecraft UIDs / UUIDs to find linked activity or associated identifiers.

#### Example:

```text
550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000
```

<Note>
- Use the full UUID when possible. Partial matches may return unrelated results.
</Note>

---

## <Icon icon="discord" iconType="solid" size={24} /> Discord ID

Search by Discord numeric ID.

#### Example:

```text
1098175931635482634
```

<Note>
- Discord IDs are deterministic.
</Note>

---

# <Icon icon="sparkles" iconType="solid" size={24} /> Snusbase (breach datasets)

Snusbase is a breach/leak aggregator. Use the appropriate type to focus breach searches.

### <Icon icon="envelope" iconType="solid" size={20} /> email
Search leaked email addresses.

#### Example:

```text
test@gmail.com
```

<Note>
- Returns leaked entries where the email appears.
</Note>

---

### <Icon icon="user" iconType="solid" size={24} /> Username
Search account handles / usernames found in leaks.

#### Example:

```text
te5t_user
```

<Note>
- Useful to find usernames reused across breaches.
</Note>

---

### <Icon icon="server" iconType="solid" size={24} /> IP
Search last-observed IPs associated with leaked records.

#### Example:

```text
203.0.113.45
```

<Note>
- IP hits show where a record listed an IP address (connections, logs, etc.).
</Note>

---

### <Icon icon="lock" iconType="solid" size={24} /> Password
Search plaintext passwords found in leaks (do not store or share).

#### Example:

```text
T3st123!
```

<Note>
- Handle plaintext password hits with strict controls and do not redistribute.
</Note>

---

### <Icon icon="hash" iconType="solid" size={24} /> Hash
Search hashed credentials or password hashes.

#### Example:

```text
5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99
```

<Note>
- Hash hits may require additional cracking/context to map back to plaintext.
</Note>

---

### <Icon icon="id-badge" iconType="solid" size={24} /> Name
Search person or display names present in leak entries.

#### Example:

```text
John Doe
```

<Note>
- Names are noisy — combine with other fields (email/username) for precision.
</Note>

---

### <Icon icon="link" iconType="solid" size={24} /> Domain
Search domain or host references present in leak entries.

#### Example:

```text
example.com
```

<Note>
- Use to find leak entries that reference specific domains or hosts.
</Note>
