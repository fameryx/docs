## <Icon icon="calendar" iconType="solid" size={24} /> Examples of complex queries

Below are ready-to-paste examples that combine fields for realistic investigative searches. Each block includes a short note explaining what it returns.

#### 1) Images from a specific author in the SearchHub server, before a date

```text
GuildName:SearchHub Author:1098175931635482634 Has:image Before:2025-06-01
```

<Note>
  Returns image attachments posted by the specified author in the SearchHub server before 2025-06-01.
</Note>

#### 2) Videos in a specific channel during May 2025

```text
Guild:1297902764881477643 Channel:1409239333432459354 Has:video After:2025-05-01 Before:2025-06-01
```

<Note>
  Finds video attachments posted in the given channel between 2025-05-01 and 2025-06-01.
</Note>

#### 3) Messages mentioning a license-like token and containing links

```text
content:license Has:link
```

<Note>
  Good for surface-level scans for shared tokens/keys accompanied by links. Combine with a guild or author to reduce noise.
</Note>

#### 4) Cross-server username search with optional timeframe

```text
Username:testt After:2025-01-01 Before:2025-07-01
```

<Note>
  Searches for the account handle 'testt' across indexed servers within the given date range.
</Note>

#### 5) High-precision: server \+ author \+ attachment type \+ keyword

```text
GuildName:SearchHub Author:1098175931635482634 Has:image content:screenshot
```

<Note>
  Returns messages from the author in the SearchHub guild containing images and the word "screenshot" — useful for visual evidence collection.
</Note>

<Check>
  - Combine ID fields (Guild, Channel, Author) for deterministic results.
  - Use `Has:<type>` to quickly filter attachments.
  - Dates use YYYY-MM-DD (add HH:MM if you need exact time).
  - Paste examples directly in the dashboard search box to iterate quickly.
